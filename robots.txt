# Also, there is no need to make website copiers make local copies of this website.

# Actually, it's just a matter of cloning or forking the repository on GitHub.
# However, all of this should deter most of idiots from doing it.
#
# All I want is to block offline copiers, online ones like Archive.org are welcome to make copies of this website.
# I don't pay a single Euro on hosting this website, so who cares of saving bandwidth (but remember that "cloud" = "somebody else's computer").
# Including shitty search engines who repeatedly download entire websites ad nauseam (yes, I'm talking to you, Bing).
