# waluigibsod.github.io

My (small and raw) personal website.

## How was made

Made using [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/KDE/ghostwriter) and [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus) with only HTML and CSS, no JavaScript as it's not needed (but it's used in other repositories as they actually need it).

It's very minimalist, but looks pretty good overall.

## 404 error page

It's a troll, embeds [a video made more than 10 years ago by Supastarrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcDPt6vxkKs), left intentionally mute to make the video auto-play.

It can be triggered by visiting every page that doesn't exist, except ones inside other repositories where GitHub Pages is enabled.

Here are some funny examples:

* https://waluigibsod.github.io/download-more-ram
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/free-discord-nitro-gift-link-generator
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/sound-fantasy-final-rom-download
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/super-mario-64-shoshinkai-1995-beta-download
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/tcrf.net-registration-key-generator
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/twitter-free-verification-checkmark-method
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/waluigibsod-face-reveal
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/wata-games-leaked-confidential-romset

Did this on purpose, in case I have the need to (e.g. when some [beytah kid](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Beytah%20Kid) pesters me for prototypes that are not even confirmed to exist anymore or that never existed).
