# waluigibsod.github.io

My (small and raw) personal website.

## How was Made

Made using [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) and [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus) with only HTML and CSS, no JavaScript as it's not needed (but it's used in other repositories as they actually need it).

It's very minimalist, but looks pretty good overall.

## 404 Error Page

It's a troll, embeds [a video made years ago by Supastarrio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcDPt6vxkKs), left intentionally mute to make the video auto-play.

It can be triggered by visiting every page that doesn't exist, except ones inside other repositories where GitHub Pages is enabled, here are some funny examples:

* https://waluigibsod.github.io/download-more-ram
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/tcrf-ban-appeals-form
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/waluigibsod-face-reveal
* https://waluigibsod.github.io/wata-games-leaked-romset

Did this on purpose, in case I have the need to (e.g. when some [beytah kid](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Beytah%20Kid) pesters me for prototypes that are not even confirmed to exist anymore or that never existed).
